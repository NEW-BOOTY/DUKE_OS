# SentientNet

**A Self-Evolving, Blockchain-Secured, Quantum-Tolerant Operating Intelligence**

---

## Overview

SentientNet is a next-generation distributed Java-native AI operating system designed to autonomously harden its own security, predict future architectural failures, self-repair and evolve its codebase using AI and formal verification, while interacting through CLI, REST, and hardware drivers — all embedded into a tamper-proof, consensus-driven execution framework deployed on the edge.

---

## Architecture

- **Modular design**: Independent Maven modules for scalability and maintainability.
- **Blockchain-backed logging**: Immutable ledger ensures tamper-proof audit trails.
- **Quantum-tolerant security**: Post-quantum cryptography securing all communications.
- **Formal verification**: Rigorous proof-based code correctness and integrity checks.
- **Self-Architect module**: AI-driven code rewriting and evolution.
- **Edge Mesh networking**: Decentralized P2P consensus and task distribution.
- **Multi-interface support**: CLI, REST APIs, and hardware I/O bridging.
