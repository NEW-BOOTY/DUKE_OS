Creating a self-hosted cybersecurity portfolio allows you to showcase your skills, projects, certifications, and experience in a secure and controlled environment. Hereâ€™s how to build a self-hosted cybersecurity portfolio:

1. Define Your Portfolioâ€™s Purpose

Before building, decide what you want to showcase:

Penetration testing reports
CTF (Capture The Flag) write-ups
Reverse engineering or malware analysis
Security research & advisories
Custom security tools/scripts
Certifications (e.g., OSCP, CISSP, CEH, etc.)
Bug bounty reports
2. Choose Your Hosting Environment

Since you want a self-hosted portfolio, you can choose:

VPS (Virtual Private Server): DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, Vultr
On-Prem Server: A self-hosted web server using Apache or Nginx
Raspberry Pi: A lightweight web server for self-hosting
3. Set Up Your Web Server

Install a web server:

sudo apt update && sudo apt install apache2 -y   # Install Apache
sudo systemctl enable apache2 && sudo systemctl start apache2
Or use Nginx:

sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo systemctl enable nginx && sudo systemctl start nginx
If using a VPS, configure firewall rules:

sudo ufw allow 80/tcp  # Allow HTTP
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp # Allow HTTPS
sudo ufw enable
4. Choose a Technology Stack

Static Site (Simple)
Use HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or Bootstrap for quick setup)
Jekyll, Hugo, or Pelican for a lightweight static website
Deploy using GitHub Actions + rsync to update easily
Dynamic Site (Advanced)
Flask/Django (Python)
Express.js (Node.js)
PHP + MySQL for WordPress-style sites
5. Secure Your Portfolio

Since this is a cybersecurity portfolio, security is key: âœ… Use HTTPS: Get a free SSL certificate with Letâ€™s Encrypt

sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
âœ… Enable firewall rules
âœ… Disable directory listing in Apache/Nginx
âœ… Use Fail2Ban to prevent brute-force attacks
âœ… Enable logging & monitoring (e.g., Wazuh, Suricata, or ELK stack)

6. Add Content

Some key sections to include:

About Me â€“ Your background & experience
Projects â€“ Security tools, exploits, reports
Blog/Write-ups â€“ CTF challenges, security research
Certifications â€“ Showcase OSCP, CEH, CISSP, etc.
Contact Info â€“ GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Email (use a contact form)
7. Automate Backups

To prevent data loss:

tar -czf backup.tar.gz /var/www/html
scp backup.tar.gz user@remote-server:/backup/location
Or use rsync for automated syncing.

8. (Optional) Deploy on the Dark Web

If you want anonymity, host your portfolio on Tor:

Install Tor:
sudo apt install tor
Configure hidden service in /etc/tor/torrc:
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
Restart Tor:
sudo systemctl restart tor
Your .onion address will be generated in /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname.

9. Test for Security

Before making it public, scan for vulnerabilities:

Nikto:
nikto -h http://yourdomain.com
OWASP ZAP for web security testing
Fail2Ban and iptables for protection
Regular security updates to avoid exploits
10. Launch & Promote

Once secure, promote your site:

GitHub README (link your portfolio)
LinkedIn & Twitter (share projects)
Bug bounty platforms (if applicable)
Final Thoughts
A self-hosted cybersecurity portfolio is a powerful way to showcase your skills. By following these steps, you ensure that your site is secure, professional, and well-maintained. Would you like me to generate a basic HTML/CSS template for your portfolio? ðŸš€

Creating an online or self-hosted cybersecurity portfolio is a great way to showcase your skills, projects, and certifications to potential employers. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to setting up a professional cybersecurity portfolio:

1. Define What to Include in Your Portfolio

Your portfolio should highlight your skills, experience, and projects. Consider including:
âœ… About Me â€“ Brief intro, career goals, and expertise
âœ… Certifications â€“ OSCP, CEH, CISSP, Security+, etc.
âœ… Projects â€“ CTF challenges, penetration tests, security tools
âœ… Write-Ups â€“ Blog posts on cybersecurity research, exploits, or tutorials
âœ… Resume & Contact Info â€“ Link to your LinkedIn, GitHub, or email

2. Choose Hosting: Online vs. Self-Hosted

You have two options for hosting your cybersecurity portfolio:

Option 1: Online Hosting (Easier)
GitHub Pages (Free, easy to set up)
Netlify (For static sites, easy deployment)
WordPress.com (More flexible, but requires maintenance)
Option 2: Self-Hosting (More Control)
VPS (Virtual Private Server) â€“ DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS
On-Prem Server â€“ Apache/Nginx web server
Tor Hidden Service (For anonymity)
3. Build Your Portfolio Website

Option 1: Static Website (Fast & Secure)
Use HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Bootstrap for a sleek design
Generate with Jekyll, Hugo, or Pelican (GitHub Pages compatible)
Example GitHub Pages Setup:

Create a GitHub Repository (e.g., my-cybersecurity-portfolio)
Clone the repository and create an index.html file
Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages under repository settings
Option 2: Dynamic Website (More Features)
Flask/Django (Python) â€“ Secure backend with login system
WordPress with Security Plugins â€“ If you prefer CMS-based sites
4. Secure Your Portfolio

Since you're in cybersecurity, your portfolio should follow best security practices:
âœ… Use HTTPS â€“ Secure with Letâ€™s Encrypt:

sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
âœ… Disable Directory Listing â€“ Prevent unauthorized file access
âœ… Enable Firewall Rules â€“ Use ufw to block unwanted traffic:

sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw enable
âœ… Use Fail2Ban â€“ Protect against brute-force attacks
âœ… Update Regularly â€“ Keep your server software up to date

5. Add Projects & Write-Ups

Make your portfolio stand out by showcasing:
âœ… Security Research â€“ Share vulnerability research or bug bounty reports
âœ… Penetration Testing Reports â€“ Document ethical hacking assessments
âœ… CTF Write-Ups â€“ Walkthroughs of solved security challenges
âœ… Custom Security Tools â€“ Open-source scripts/tools youâ€™ve built

6. Automate Backups (For Self-Hosted Sites)

Use tar and rsync for regular backups:

tar -czf backup.tar.gz /var/www/html
scp backup.tar.gz user@remote-server:/backup/location
Or set up automated GitHub commits for static sites.

7. Make It Discoverable

âœ… SEO Optimization â€“ Use keywords in meta tags
âœ… LinkedIn & GitHub â€“ Add portfolio links to your profile
âœ… Share on Security Forums â€“ Post in cybersecurity communities

8. (Optional) Deploy on the Dark Web

If you want anonymity, deploy your portfolio as a Tor hidden service:

Install Tor:
sudo apt install tor
Configure hidden service in /etc/tor/torrc:
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
Restart Tor:
sudo systemctl restart tor
Your .onion address will be generated in /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname.
